Women with PCOD should try to maintain a PCOS diet chart to ensure that they are including an adequate proportion of all nutritional elements and a healthy balance of a wide variety of foods in their diet. A weight loss diet for PCOD will also follow similar guidelines but at a caloric deficit depending on your BMI and BMR metrics.

Foods to Avoid for PCOD: What Not To Eat
Traditional Indian food is rich in wholesome grains, lentils, immune-boosting ingredients and healing spices and herbs. However, Indian food has also evolved to include unhealthy, and nutrient-devoid ingredients such as refined and processed flours saturated fats and sugars as well. Many of these foods can make PCOS worse and should be avoided completely especially in a weight loss diet for PCOD.

Here is a list of Indian foods to avoid for PCOD:

<br><br>
<b>1. Starchy Vegetables</b><br>

Consumption of starchy vegetables such as sweet potato, yam, peas, corn, taro and squash should be limited in your PCOD diet plan. Starchy vegetables are rich in carbohydrates and can quickly raise a personâ€™s blood sugar levels, causing an imbalance in hormones.

<br><br>
<b>2. Fruit Juices, Processed Fruit Concentrates and Canned Fruit</b><br>

Fruit juices, canned fruit and processed fruit concentrates should be eliminated from the PCOD diet chart as they are likely to contain high doses of added sugar. The Indian diet for PCOD should ideally contain fresh or frozen fruit as they posess more beneficial fibres and nutrients.
<br><br>
<b>3. Vegetable Oils</b><br>

Vegetable oils are highly processed and can be inflammatory for women with PCOD due to their high ratio of omega-6 fatty acids. They are also linked to obesity, cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, in the diet plan for PCOD, healthier alternatives such as coconut oil, ghee, olive oil or avocado oil should be included.

<br><br>
<b>4. Sugary Foods</b><br>

India has a variety of decadent desserts such as gulab jamun, kulfi, gajar ka halwa, cakes, cookies and Kheer. Most of these desserts are a high-calorie affair and are loaded with large amounts of sugar that can adversely impact PCOD in women.

<br><br>
<b>5. Fried Foods</b><br>

Fried foods such as pakoras, samosas and fritters are high in saturated and hydrogenated fats. These unhealthy fats can increase estrogen production and are not preferred in the diet chart for PCOS patient.

<br><br>
<b>6. Refined and Processed Foods</b><br>

Refined and processed carbs and foods such as white bread, white rice, instant oatmeal, rice cakes and white pasta are stripped of fibre and their original nutrient content and should be eliminated from the PCOD diet food chart.

<br><br>
<b>7. Red Meat</b><br>

Women with PCOD should limit their consumption of red meats such as pork, beef and mutton. These foods can aggravate existing hormonal problems as they are high in cholesterol
and saturated fats. In addition, processed meats are especially high in sodium and treated with various preservatives and additives. These include sausages, bacon, ham and salami, foods that should be excluded from the diet chard for PCOD.

<br><br>
<b>8. Alcohol and Caffeine</b><br>

Alcohol and caffeine can be problematic for women with PCOS. While alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver disease, caffeine can promote anxiety and kick-in stress hormones which in turn can spike up insulin levels.

<br><br>
<b>9. Dairy Products</b><br>

Dairy has a hormone called IGF-1 which can mimic insulin in the body, thereby causing blood sugar levels to spike and worsening symptoms of PCOS in women. Plus, regular dairy products might be laced with hormones or antibiotics that are commonly fed to animals. This can interfere with the hormones of a woman and may make it increasingly difficult to manage symptoms of PCOS.
